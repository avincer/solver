Code Review
===========
- use typedef in place of unsigned char when an instruction type is meant?
- check useage of random getInt method - should it be int?
- recordProgramScore on IProgramFactory doesn't accept argument by reference - why not?
- remove toXml method from factory - writing that much xml is neither expedient nor useful!
- try to use unique_ptr properly...
- review use of copying objects when we could use a pointer or a reference
